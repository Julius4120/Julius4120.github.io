I'm new to all thisðŸ˜….
I do not really consider myself a programmer, I only write this script to decrease human workload, have fun and increase efficiency. Feel free to email me at opeayobello@gmail.com if you need me.

A collection of my Python projects, including web scraping, automation scripts, and data extraction tools. Showcasing my skills in BeautifulSoup, Selenium, and API integration is listed below.

## ðŸ”¹ Projects:
- **[Time Machine (Spotify Playlist Creator)](https://github.com/Julius4120/Julius4120.github.io/blob/main/Time_machine.py)**

- **[One Task](https://onetask-duuz.onrender.com/)** - A full-stack web application that lets you access your tasks from anywhere. Features a beautiful, responsive UI powered by a secure Flask REST API with user authentication. Create an account and your todo list will follow you on any device.


  âœ¨ Features:
  - User Registration & Login
  -  Secure REST API
  -  Create, Read, Update, Delete Tasks
  -  Persistent Data Storage
  -  Clean & Modern UI

- **[Flask Authentication practice](https://basit-test-page2.onrender.com/login)** - A functional web application demonstrating a complete user authentication system built with Flask. The project implements protected routes, user session management, and login redirects, serving as a practical example of core web security concepts.
The core functionality is gating access to a downloadable resource (a fun PDF guide on Python) behind a login wall, forcing unauthorized users through the authentication workflow.  


  Key Features Demonstrated:
  - User Registration & Login: Secure account creation and authentication.
  - Protected Routes: Middleware checks for user authentication on specific pages.
  - Login Redirects: Unauthenticated users attempting to access /secret are automatically redirected to the login page.
  - Session Management: User sessions are maintained securely after login.
  - File Serving: Authorized users can download a static file (PDF) from a protected route.
  - Tech Stack: Flask, Flask-Login, Werkzeug Security, HTML, CSS.


## ðŸ’» Technologies Used:
- Python (BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Requests, Spotipy API, e.t.c)
- API Integration  
- Data Automation
- Rest API with Flask
