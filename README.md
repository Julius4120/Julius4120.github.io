I'm new to all thisðŸ˜….
I do not really consider myself a programmer, I only write this script to decrease human workload, have fun and increase efficiency. Feel free to email me at opeayobello@gmail.com if you need me.

A collection of my Python projects, including web scraping, automation scripts, and data extraction tools. Showcasing my skills in BeautifulSoup, Selenium, and API integration is listed below.

## ðŸ”¹ Projects:
- **[Time Machine (Spotify Playlist Creator)](https://github.com/Julius4120/Julius4120.github.io/blob/main/Time_machine.py)**  
  A time machine that takes you back in time and bring back some good memories. This script was one of my very first client projects. It automatically adds the top 100 songs of a particular year to a Spotify playlist.
  
- **[Anime Downloader](https://github.com/Julius4120/Julius4120.github.io/tree/main/Anime%20downloader)** - This is a lightweight script i wrote to automate downloading of bulk anime from an anime site(Animepahe.ru)(I'm a big fan), it just goes up to the website based on user's request of course and does it's thing, it also shows tells the user when each download is complete and all.
  
- **[Price Tracker](https://github.com/Julius4120/Julius4120.github.io/blob/main/Price_tracker.py)** - Amazon price tracker, This script keeps checking the price of a specified product on Amazon and notifies my client through email when the price reaches their target price.
  
- **[Instagram crawler](https://github.com/Julius4120/Julius4120.github.io/tree/main/Instagram_crawler)** - Instagram Crawler â€“ The fastest way to gain followers is by following people who are genuinely interested in your content. This script automates that process! It can follow all the followers of a specific account based on user inputâ€”(handling up to 2,000 follows in less than 20 minutes).
  
- **[Data Entry Automation](https://github.com/Julius4120/Julius4120.github.io/blob/main/Data_entry_automation.py)** - Automatically extracts data from a website and fills it into a Google Form. ðŸš€
  
- **[Stock news alert](https://github.com/Julius4120/Julius4120.github.io/blob/main/Stock_news_alert.py)** - Automatic stock news alert using various API's
  
- **[One Task](https://onetask-duuz.onrender.com/)** - A full-stack web application that lets you access your tasks from anywhere. Features a beautiful, responsive UI powered by a secure Flask REST API with user authentication. Create an account and your todo list will follow you on any device.

  âœ¨ Features:
  - User Registration & Login
  -  Secure REST API
  -  Create, Read, Update, Delete Tasks
  -  Persistent Data Storage
  -  Clean & Modern UI

- **[Flask Authentication practice](https://basit-test-page2.onrender.com/login)** - A functional web application demonstrating a complete user authentication system built with Flask. The project implements protected routes, user session management, and login redirects, serving as a practical example of core web security concepts.
The core functionality is gating access to a downloadable resource (a fun PDF cheat_sheet on Python) behind a login wall, forcing unauthorized users through the authentication workflow.  

  Key Features Demonstrated:
  - User Registration & Login: Secure account creation and authentication.
  - Protected Routes: Middleware checks for user authentication on specific pages.
  - Login Redirects: Unauthenticated users attempting to access /secret are automatically redirected to the login page.
  - Session Management: User sessions are maintained securely after login.
  - File Serving: Authorized users can download a static file (PDF) from a protected route.
  - Tech Stack: Flask, Flask-Login, Werkzeug Security, HTML, CSS.

- **[ðŸš€ AstroGym - VR Fitness Concept Landing Page](https://julius4120.github.io/Astrogym/)** - This project was a creative front-end challenge to conceptualize a next-generation gym. The core idea of AstroGym is to integrate Virtual Reality (VR) with a zero-gravity space aesthetic, transforming mundane workouts into an exciting interstellar adventure.

    The goal of the landing page was to immediately capture this futuristic and energetic vibe  and also increase conversion ratio. I leveraged the powerful GSAP animation library to create smooth scroll-triggered animations, parallax        effects, and dynamic transitions that make the page feel alive and interactive, perfectly matching the innovative concept. It was quite a challenge cuz front-end is not rlly my thing.
    Key Highlights:

  - Immersive Concept: Designed to sell the vision of a VR-based, space-themed workout facility.

  - Advanced Animations: Utilized GSAP for complex timeline animations and scroll-based effects for a narrative flow.

  - Modern Frontend Stack: Built from scratch with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for full creative control.

  - Responsive Design: Ensures the cosmic experience is seamless across all device types.
